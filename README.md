# What is Fall Timer?

Fall Timer is a cozy pomodoro-style focus timer inspired by autumn. It helps you work deeply and rest fully with warm fall visuals, ambient sounds (leaves rustling, soft rain), and easy-to-use session controls to adjust your time, it even has a notepad for you to note things.

On mobile however there is only a timer nothing else as the screen size is small.

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSRl41Pwb1s) showcasing the platform in action.
